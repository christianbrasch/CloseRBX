## How does it work?

It works by using one line of code in the Windows command prompt to close the program. This is an alternative way to close the ROBLOX Player.

## Is it safe?
As mentioned before, this uses one line of code in the **Windows** Command Prompt, so **its safe!**

## I don't wanna download this, Can I have the line of code?
Sure! You can run this in command prompt to close the app, or Save it as a .bat file by doing these steps:

Paste the code into your notepad
File --> Save As (Located at the Top Right of the Notepad program)
At the bottom of the pop up window, theres a section that says "Save as type"
Change that to All Files, then name the file "CloseRBX.bat" and press save.
The code to run in command prompt or to make a bat file is below:

```markdown
taskkill /im RobloxPlayerBeta.exe /t /f
```
